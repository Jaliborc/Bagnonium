        <strong>Bagnonium</strong> is Bagnon with a twist.
        It is a bag replacement addon designed to help the player find items as quickly and as easily as possible, while still feeling part of the default interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        It has all the features from Bagnon, plus some extra functionality.
        It organizes all bags into a single window, highlights important items, sorts items on request and helps you find them using a search engine.
        It supports the inventory, bank, void storage and guild bank, which can be viewed at any time, from anywhere and from any character!
