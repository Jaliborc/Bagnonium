# Bagnon :handbag:
Bagnon is Bagnon with a twist. It is a bag replacement addon designed to help the player find items as quickly and as easily as possible, while still feeling part of the default interface.

It has all the features from Bagnon, plus some extra functionality. It organizes all bags into a single window, highlights important items, sorts items on request and helps you find them using a search engine. It supports the inventory, bank, void storage and guild bank, which can be viewed at any time, from anywhere and from any character!
    
If you're looking for more features, many different [plugins](https://github.com/Jaliborc/BagBrother/wiki/Plugins) have been made by the community. If you are a developer, Bagnon provides a rich [API](https://github.com/Jaliborc/BagBrother/wiki). If you want instead a more minimalitic alternative, try [Bagnon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon).
